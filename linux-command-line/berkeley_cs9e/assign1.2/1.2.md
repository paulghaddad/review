## Overview

This assignment will give you an overview of the UNIX shell. The shell is your
basic means of interaction with the system. Because you are using a cs9e
account, we have customized your shell for use in this course. Shell accounts
that you have on other systems and for other classes will more than likely look
slightly different, but they all behave similarly. This assignment will teach
you how to use the shell and how to customize it for your own needs.

## Starter Code

Please download the starter code from above. It should contains a single file
called all.batters.1988.txt which will be used for Part 3.

## Part 1: Metacharacters and Quoting

1. From within your home directory, perform an ls operation which shows all directories that begin with a ".". You should not see plain files, and you should not see the contents of these directories.

Example:

```
$ ls _____________
../  ./  .ssh/  .ssh2/  .sunw/  .tin/
```

Answer: `ls -ld \.?*`

2.Use quoting or escaping where necessary (and only where necessary) to properly
create directories with the following names:

```
!*: 
$HOME
...
"What's For Dinner?"
-
```

Answers:

```
mkdir \!\*
mkdir \$HOME
mkdir \.\.\.
mkdir "What's For Dinner?"
mkdir \-
```

3. List all files in /usr/bin which begin with the letter a, b, or c.

4. Echo every 2 letter combination of a, b, c, and d including doubles. Do not
   write out all combinations manually, and do not use loops.

i.e.:

```
$ echo __________
aa ab ac ad ba bb bc bd ca cb cc cd da db dc dd
```

Answer:

```
echo {a..d}{a..d}
```

## Part 2: Environment Customization

Make the necessary changes to your shell configuration files to do the
following.

Your tasks:

1. Change your prompt.

```
Modify PS1 env variable
```

2. Create a ~/.todo which is displayed whenever you login remotely but not when
   you open a terminal X.

```
Create .todo
Add function to .bash_profile to cat the .todo file
```


3. Create a directory "bin/" in your home directory, and add this directory to your
shell's path. Once you've done this, any executable in "bin/" can be run by
invoking its file name on the shell, rather than giving the path to the
executable. What is the order in which paths are searched? What problems can you
foresee if "bin/" is added to the beginning of the list?

```
Add export PATH="~/bin:${PATH}" to .bashrc

Programs in this directory will supercede those in system directories,
potentially causing problems
```

4. Add a command alias to your shell. If you use emacs as editor, one convenient
alias suppresses emacs starting an X11 window. You can achieve this by running
emacs with the -nw option.

```
Add to .bashrc:

alias ll="ls -la"

5. How can you see all the environment varaiables in your shell?

```
env | less
```

6. How are you able to see shell variables as well?


```
set | less
```

7. Print out the `$HOME` environment variable output by `env` using two
   approaches:

```
printenv HOME

echo $HOME
```

8. How can you print out a string containing an environment variable?


```
echo "The current user is ${HOME}"
```

9. Create a shell variable that will be available in the environment (ie,
   printenv VARNAME works):

```
MY_VAR=abc
export MY_VAR
env | grep MY_VAR

This can also be done in one step: export MY_VAR=abc
```

10. Now, try to unset it:

```
unset MY_VAR
```

11. Create a mcd function in `.bashrc`:

```
function mcd() {
  mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}
```

12. How can you see your current keyboard bindings?

```
bind -p | less
```



## Part 3: Piping and Redirection

The file all.batters.1988.txt from starter code contains the Final Official 1988
American League batter statistics. The "position" category lists positions at
which the player played 20 or more games. Each line of the file contains the
following information about a player, organized into fields separated by one or
more blanks:

his name
his team
his position or positions
whether he bats right-handed or left-handed
his batting average (hits divided by at-bats)
the number of games he played
how many "at bats" he had
how many runs he scored
how many hits he had
how many total bases he had (1 for each single, 2 for each double, etc.
how many doubles
how many triples
how many home runs
how many runs batted in
how many sacrifice hits
how many sacrifice flies
how many times he was hit by a pitch
how many walks
how many intentional walks
how many times he struck out
how many stolen bases
how many times he was caught stealing
how many double-plays he hit into
his on-base-average

Use piping and UNIX commands you have learned about to answer the following
questions.

Your tasks:

1. Devise a single pipeline (a command constructed entirely of one or more pipes)
that prints the names and batting averages of the ten players whose batting
averages are the highest. (Hint: Our solution uses tr, sort, cut, and head)

Answer:

```
tr -s ' ' ' ' < all.batters.1988.txt | cut -d ' ' -f1,5 | sort -nr -k 2 | head
-n10
```

2. Devise a single pipeline that prints the name of the batter who played the
   most games of all batters who hit no home runs along with the number of games
he played. (Hint: Our solution uses tr, cut, sort, and head)

Answer:

```
tr -s ' ' "\t" < all.batters.1988.txt | cut -f 1,6,13 | sort -nk 3 | head | sort
-nrk 2 | cut -f1,2
```

3. Devise a pair of commands not containing any semicolons, that prints the
   names of batters that were in the top ten both in batting average and in
number of home runs. The first command will generate a file containing the names
of the players with the top ten batting averages; the next command will compare
these names with the top ten home run hitters. (Hint: Our solution uses tr,
sort, cut, head, and comm. Make sure that hitters with the same number of home
runs are arranged in order by batting average.)

Answer:

```
comm -12 top_ten_batting_averages.txt top_ten_home_runs.txt
```
